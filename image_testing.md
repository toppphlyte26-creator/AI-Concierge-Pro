# Image Integration Testing Rules

## Image Handling Rules
- Always use base64-encoded images for all tests and requests.
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, WEBP only.
- Do not use SVG, BMP, HEIC, or other formats.
- Do not upload blank, solid-color, or uniform-variance images.
- Every image must contain real visual features — objects, edges, textures, shadows.
- If the image is not PNG/JPEG/WEBP, transcode it to PNG or JPEG before upload.
- If MIME auto-detected differs from filename ext after conversion, re-detect and update the MIME.
- If the image is animated (GIF, APNG, WEBP animation), extract the first frame only.
- Resize large images to reasonable bounds (avoid oversized payloads).
